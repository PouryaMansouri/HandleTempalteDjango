üëã Hey there! Templates are a crucial part of building web applications in Django, and there are some best practices to follow to make sure your templates are well-organized and easy to manage. Here are my top tips for handling templates in Django:

### üé® Setting Configuration
When it comes to configuring templates in Django, the `TEMPLATES` setting in your project's `settings.py` file is where you'll define how Django should handle templates. One best practice is to use the `DIRS` setting to specify a global templates directory outside of the individual app directories. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to share templates across different apps. Here's an example:

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [
            BASE_DIR / 'templates',
        ],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            # ...
        },
    },
]
```

In this example, we're using `BASE_DIR` to specify the path to our project's root directory, and then adding a `templates` directory inside of that. The `APP_DIRS` option is set to `True`, which means that Django will still look for templates inside each app's `templates` directory as well.

### üìÅ Storing Templates
One important best practice for storing templates is to keep them organized and easy to find. My recommendation is to create a `templates` directory at the root level of your project and then organize templates into subdirectories based on their purpose. For example, you might have a `templates/base` directory for base templates that are shared across multiple apps, a `templates/blog` directory for templates specific to your blog app, and so on.

### üì¶ Collecting Static Files
When it comes to serving static files in Django, it's important to use the `collectstatic` command to collect all of your static files into a single directory that can be served by your web server. To use the `collectstatic` command, you'll need to specify a `STATIC_ROOT` directory in your project's settings file, like this:

```python
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'
```

Then, you can run the `collectstatic` command to collect all of your static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory:

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Changing the Django Admin Template
If you want to customize the look and feel of the Django admin interface, you can do so by creating your own custom admin template. To do this, you'll need to create a directory called `templates/admin/` in one of your app directories (or in your global templates directory if you're using that approach), and then create a copy of the default admin template (`admin/base_site.html`) inside that directory.

From there, you can customize the template as much as you like, using Django's template tags and filters to add dynamic content and styling. Just be sure to test your changes thoroughly, as the admin interface can be tricky to work with!

That's it for my top tips on handling templates in Django. Remember to keep things organized, use the `collectstatic` command to serve static files, and have fun customizing your templates! üé®
